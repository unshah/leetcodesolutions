/* 
There is a programming language with only four operations and one variable X:

++X and X++ increments the value of the variable X by 1.
--X and X-- decrements the value of the variable X by 1.
Initially, the value of X is 0.

Given an array of strings operations containing a list of operations, return the final value of X after performing all the operations.

*/
// Solution:-
 
 var finalValueAfterOperations = function(operations) {
    let x =0;
    for(let i=0; i< operations.length; i++){
        if(operations[i] == "++X" || operations[i] == "X++"){
            x +=1;
        }
        else {
            x -=1;
        }
    }
    return x;
};
